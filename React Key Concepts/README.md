### Goals: Become a react developer that can make good architectural decision and lead projects

React came out in 2013 before then we had static website with only html, css and js and there came the problem of cross browser compatibility.This Problem was solved to some extent by jQuery, the backbone and the Single Page Application and AJAX.
On 2010 came Angularjs by google with a lot of packages to wrap our application on until it was discovered that the organization made it hard to find bugs.
